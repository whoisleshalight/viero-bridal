						<div class="vision__info">
							<p>When I moved to the US, I was surprised to see so many wedding dress retailers. Being a
								fashionista, I was excited about how many dress options I’d have. Sadly, I discovered most
								retailers sold the same tired dress designs. The industry was apathetic about making brides feel
								unforgettable on their big day.
							<p>I opened the first VIERO boutique in Chicago to change this. Soon I was partnering with top
								notch designers who felt the same way I did.</p>

								<div class="item-selection__info">
									<p>With my first VIERO boutique, I quickly noticed a disconnect between retailers and dress
										producers. Tired dress designs came from manufacturers that didn’t have experience helping
										brides. Producing the same dress each year was good for their profit, and brides would buy
										them because retailers couldn’t get anything else from producers. Retailers and brides
										were
										frustrated.</p>
									<p>That’s when I knew VIERO could be exceptional. We would get to know brides in our own
										boutiques, and we’d use that knowledge to bring brides and other retailers the fresh looks
										they wanted.</p>

								<div class="item-selection__info">
									<p>Wedding dresses are expensive. Even shops that claim low prices are only inexpensive on a
										relative basis. One of the biggest barriers I faced when I introduced fresh looks that
										were
										handcrafted was convincing brides that this level of quality could fit their budget.
										Brides
										can expect more without overspending.</p>
									<p>I continue to believe every bride should expect to have a wedding dress that is
										thoughtfully
										designed and finely detailed with high quality materials that make her feel more beautiful
										than ever. And she should be able to buy that dress for a reasonable price.</p>

								<h3 class="item-selection__title">Offer brides remarkable quality they can’t find anywhere else
								</h3>
								<div class="item-selection__info">
									<p>Most wedding dress shops and brands claim exceptional quality. They promise they care
										about a
										bride’s big day as much as she does. Like many brides, I’ve learned these claims are often
										untrue. A bride is the expert on her dream. No one cares about the details more than she
										does. But VIERO wants to be the next in line when it comes to getting the details perfect.
									</p>
									<p>That’s why I opened an atelier where we’ve developed VIERO’s own brand of handcrafted
										couture-inspired wedding dresses made with the finest materials and craftmanship. We’ve
										even
										grown to offer custom one-of-a-kind gowns for brides who want a dress made just for them.

						<p>Are you a bride to be curious on how to properly manage your wedding budget? Wedding planning can
							be so stressful due to factors like price and budgeting. Besides the bride and groom, there are
							many other people who will feel the heat of upcoming wedding events. As the bride, you are expected
							to have an ideal budget and you cannot be expected to cover all the costs.
						<p> It is important to keep in mind the budgets of those who are involved in your wedding as well.
							Being upfront initially about your covered costs and what you plan on having your wedding party pay
							for is the best way to avoid awkwardness while remaining transparent. If you are stuck wondering
							what you should and should not be paying for, look no further!</p>
						</p>
						<h3>1. The Bridal Shower</h3>
						<p>The bridal shower is a celebration dedicated to the bride. Even if you are more of a “hands on”
							bride who prefers to be involved in the planning aspect of things, you should not be expected to
							pay for this event.</p>
